# Comprehensive review and actionable plan for your EduProof MVP, tailored for a hackathon and real-world impact

---

## 1. Core Features Checklist

**You have:**
- Role-based onboarding (Refugee/Student, NGO, Verifier)
- Auth flows and dashboards
- UI for credential issuance and verification (structure in place)
- Soulbound NFT concept in documentation

**You need to ensure:**
- Actual smart contract for soulbound NFTs (non-transferable, one per credential)
- Credential issuance from NGO dashboard triggers NFT mint
- Verifier dashboard can check authenticity (on-chain lookup)
- IPFS or similar for storing credential metadata (diploma details, hashes, etc.)
- Wallet connect for users (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- (Optional but impactful) ZK proof demo for privacy-preserving verification

---

## 2. Blockchain Essentials Review

**NFT Issuance & Soulbound Enforcement**
- Smart contract must:
  - Mint NFTs to user wallet
  - Prevent transfer (soulbound: override transfer functions to revert)
  - Store credential metadata URI (IPFS hash)
- Use OpenZeppelin’s ERC721 + soulbound pattern (see OZ’s SBT reference)

**IPFS for Metadata**
- On credential issue, upload JSON metadata to IPFS (use Pinata, web3.storage, or Infura)
- Store returned IPFS hash in NFT

**DID Integration (Optional)**
- For hackathon, can skip full DID stack, but if time allows, use Ceramic or SpruceID for user identity

**ZK Proofs (Optional)**
- If you want a ZK demo, use Semaphore or Sismo for simple proof-of-ownership or credential validity

---

## 3. Technical Gaps / Blockers

- **No smart contract = no real NFT issuance.** This is the biggest gap.
- **No wallet integration.** Users must connect a wallet to receive NFTs.
- **No IPFS integration.** Metadata must be decentralized.
- **No on-chain verification logic.** Verifier dashboard should read from blockchain.
- **No admin/NGO access control.** Only NGOs should mint credentials.

---

## 4. Recommended Stack & Tools

- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, OpenZeppelin, deploy on Polygon Mumbai or Base Sepolia (testnet)
- **NFT Storage:** IPFS via Pinata, web3.storage, or NFT.Storage
- **Frontend:** React (already using), ethers.js or wagmi for wallet/blockchain interaction
- **Wallets:** MetaMask, WalletConnect
- **Backend (optional):** Supabase for off-chain data, but all credential proofs must be on-chain/IPFS
- **ZK Proofs (optional):** Semaphore, Sismo, or use ZK badge services for demo
- **DID (optional):** Ceramic, SpruceID

---

## Step-by-Step Breakdown to MVP

### 1. Finalize Smart Contracts
- Write ERC721 contract with soulbound logic (override transfer functions)
- Add `mintCredential(address to, string memory metadataURI)` for NGOs
- Deploy to testnet (Polygon Mumbai/Base Sepolia)
- (Optional) Add ZK verifier contract

### 2. Issue & Verify Credentials via Frontend
- Integrate wallet connect (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- NGO dashboard: Form to enter credential details → upload to IPFS → call `mintCredential`
- Refugee dashboard: Show owned NFTs (read from contract)
- Verifier dashboard: Input NFT address/tokenId → fetch metadata from IPFS → display credential

### 3. Store Metadata Securely
- On credential issue, upload JSON to IPFS (use Pinata/web3.storage API)
- Store returned hash in NFT

### 4. Manage NGO/Issuer Access & User Wallets
- Only allow minting from NGO wallets (hardcode for hackathon, or use a simple allowlist)
- Users must connect wallet to receive/view credentials

### 5. (Optional) ZK Proof Demo
- Use Semaphore/Sismo to generate proof of credential ownership without revealing details

---

## What Not to Waste Time On
- Full DID stack (unless you have time)
- Complex backend logic (keep as much on-chain as possible)
- Fancy UI polish (focus on working flows and clear demo)

| IPFS metadata          |     ✔     |              |
| Wallet connect         |     ✔     |              |
| NGO minting            |     ✔     |              |
| On-chain verification  |     ✔     |              |
| ZK Proofs              |           |      ✔       |
| DID integration        |           |      ✔       |

## Final Advice

- Focus on the end-to-end flow: NGO issues → user receives NFT → verifier checks on-chain/IPFS.
- Demo: Show wallet connect, credential mint, and verification.
- Document your contract and flows in the README for judges.

If you want, I can provide:
- A sample soulbound NFT contract
- Example React code for wallet connect and minting
- IPFS upload helper

Let me know which part you want to tackle first!
